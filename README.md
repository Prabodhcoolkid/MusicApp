# MusicApp
If you hate having to pay money for spotify or youtube music this application can benefit you if you have an mp3 reader allowing you to listen to mp3 files.

This application uses Selenium webdriver to install all songs using a youtube link.
1. Reads from a list of url
2. Based on a Selenium task worflow I developed opens a Chromedriver
3. Goes to a youtube link to mp3 website
4. Downloads using the link address generated by the website  (2 websites are available in case one goes down)
5. Checks the downloads folder for any unknown files without a .mp3 extension, as it could be malware
6. Deletes potential malware

Note this application is still under development and has loads of faults to fix.
Use at your own risk.

When I developed this application I was unaware of Linux Kernel commands.
I realized you can modify this application to extract the download url from the website and run the `wget` command to download files from the internet.
