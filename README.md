# MusicApp
This application uses Selenium webdriver to install all songs using a youtube link.
1. Reads from a list of url
2. Based on a Selenium task worflow I developed opens a Chromedriver
3. Goes to a youtube link to mp3 website
4. Downloads using the link address generated by the website  (2 websites in case one goes down)
5. Checks the downloads folder for any unknown files without a .mp4 extension, as it could be malware
6. Deletes potential malware

Note this application is still under development and has loads of faults to fix.
Use at your own risk.
